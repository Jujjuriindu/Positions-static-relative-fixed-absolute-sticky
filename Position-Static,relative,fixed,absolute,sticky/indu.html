        A garden is a planned space, usually outdoors, set aside for the
        cultivation, display, and enjoyment of plants and other forms of nature.

        The single feature identifying even the wildest wild garden is control.

      <p id="gardenPara">
        Gardens often have design features including statuary, follies,
        pergolas, trellises, stumperies, dry creek beds, and water features such
        as fountains, ponds (with or without fish), waterfalls or creeks.
      </p>
      <p class="gardenP">
        Some gardens are for ornamental purposes only, while others also produce
        food crops, sometimes in separate areas, or sometimes intermixed with
        the ornamental plants.
      </p>
      <p class="gardenP">
        Food-producing gardens are distinguished from farms by their smaller
        scale, more labor-intensive methods, and their purpose (enjoyment of a
        hobby or self-sustenance rather than producing for sale, as in a market
        garden).

      <p class="gardenP">
        Flower gardens combine plants of different heights, colors, textures,

        The most common form today is a residential or public garden, but the

        zoological gardens.

      <p class="gardenP">
        Some traditional types of eastern gardens, such as Zen gardens, however,
        use plants sparsely or not at all. Landscape gardens, on the other hand,
